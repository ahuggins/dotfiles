# dotfiles

Originally this repo was just going to have my dotfiles, but it has become a house for my development settings.


## iTerm
Here are a couple themes that I like that I found on this website: http://iterm2colorschemes.com/

#### Themes
* Galaxy
* LiquidCarbonTransparent
* Monokai Soda

#### Git in Bash Prompt
I really like this prompt: https://github.com/magicmonty/bash-git-prompt

## Sublime Themes
* Seti Theme
* Seti.tmTheme (color scheme)

## Offline docs
With Vagrant and other local development setups, you can work without being connected to the internet. But some times you might want some documentation with you. I found this app: https://kapeli.com/dash. It works well, has the style of the sites, so it looks the same. It also has the API docs. 

#### Offline docs
* Laravel
* PHP
* jQuery
* Has a lot of major frameworks in many languages.
